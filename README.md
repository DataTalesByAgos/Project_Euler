# Project Euler Solutions üßÆ

This repository contains my solutions to Project Euler problems, approached using effective coding techniques and focusing on learning mathematical concepts.

## What is Project Euler?

[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) is a collection of mathematical problems designed to be solved with programming. These problems vary in difficulty and are intended to encourage learning of both mathematics and programming.

## Objectives üéØ

- **Learning Mathematics**: Each problem presents a unique mathematical challenge. I will attempt to understand and apply relevant mathematical concepts to find efficient solutions.

- **Experimenting with Different Approaches**: I will investigate different algorithms, coding techniques, and evaluate their runtime to understand their performance characteristics.
