- Search for a library to measure code performance
- Scraping Euler problems and creating my daily math problem. A nice GUI would be fun to have; does Project Euler have an API? That would be awesome

def measure_time(func, *args):
    start_time = time.perf_counter()
    result = func(*args)
    end_time = time.perf_counter()
    execution_time = (end_time - start_time) * 1000  # Convert to milliseconds
    return result, execution_time
